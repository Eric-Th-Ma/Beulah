# My Rules of Tiến Lên

_Tiến Lên_ is a card game for 4 players. There are many rules that differ among play groups; these are the rules my family uses.
The object of the game is to get rid of all of the cards in your hand.

## Cards
Tiến Lên uses a standard, 52-card deck. The cards are ranked, from low to high: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A, 2. The cards are also ranked based on suits, from low to high: spades (♠), clubs (♣), diamonds (♦), hearts (♥). Thus, the 3♠ is the lowest ranked card in the game, and the 2♥ is the highest ranked card in the game. When ranking cards, rank takes priority over suit: a 3♥ is higher than a 3♦, but a 4♠ is higher than both of them.

## Setup
For the first game, the player with the 3♠ starts, and must start play using the 3♠. For every game after, the winner of the previous game starts, with no restrictions on their starting play. Play then continues counter-clockwise from whoever started.

## Playing the Game
The starting player starts a round by playing from their hand some combination of cards to the center of the table. There are 4 standard types of combinations:

#### Standard Combinations
  * __single__ - a single card (ex. 6♦)
  * __pair__ - two cards of the same rank (ex. 5♠ 5♦)
  * __triple__ - three cards of the same rank (ex. 8♠ 8♦ 8♥)
  * __straight__ - at least three cards of consecutive rank (9♠ 10♥ J♦ Q♦); 2's cannot be included in straights

The next player can then play a combination that beats the combination in the center, or pass.

### Beating a Combination
A combination can only be beat by a combination of the same type with a higher highest-ranked card in the combination. For example, the pair 7♠ 7♥ beats the pair 7♣ 7♦, because the highest card of the former pair (7♥) is higher than the highest card of the latter pair (7♦).

For straights, the number of cards in the straight is part of the kind of combination, so a 5-card straight can only be beaten by another 5-card straight.

### Passing
If a player cannot or does not want to beat the combination in the center, they may pass. When a player passes, they may not play any more cards until a new round begins; play will simply skip over them as it goes around the table.

### Tiến Lên
When every player has passed in a round except for one, that remaining player may _tiến lên_ (go forward) by playing 1 or more combinations to the center that beat the combination currently in the center. When a player is in _tiến lên_, other players may not play any cards. For example, if player A is the last remaining player in a round, with the pair 6♦ 6♥ in the middle, player A may play the pair 8♠ 8♥ and then the pair 10♠ 10♦ and stay in _tiến lên_, so no player may attempt to beat either of those pairs. Note that player A could not play those pairs in the opposite order and stay in _tiến lên_: if player A played the pair 10♠ 10♦ first, then the pair 8♠ 8♥ does not beat the combination currently in the center (10♠ 10♦) and could not be played while staying in _tiến lên_.

Whether the remaining player plays any cards in _tiến lên_, that player will then start a new round of play by playing some combination of cards to the center.

### Chops
Chops are special combinations of cards that beat 2's, the highest cards in the game. There are 3 types of chops:

  * __3 consecutive pairs__ - three pairs of cards, with the pairs being of consecutive rank (ex. 6♦ 6♥ 7♦ 7♥ 8♠ 8♦); beats any
  single 2
  * __4 of a kind__ - four cards of the same rank (ex. 5♠ 5♣ 5♦ 5♥), beats any single 2
  * __4 consecutive pairs__ - four pairs of cards, with the pairs being of consecutive rank (ex. 6♦ 6♥ 7♦ 7♥ 8♠ 8♦ 9♣ 9♦), beats any single 2 or any pair of 2's

Chops can only be played to beat a 2 (or pair of 2's, for 4 consecutive pairs) or to start a round. Therefore, during a round of single cards, a chop can be played to beat a 2♠, but not an A♥.

Chops can be beaten like any other combination, following the identical same type, highest card rule.

## Winning
When a player runs out of cards in their hand, they win. When a player wins, other players continue play as normal, essentially skipping that player during play. If the player finished during _tiến lên_ or all other players pass the final combination that player played, the next player counter-clockwise starts a new round.

The game continues until there is only one player left with cards in their hand. Rankings are based on when players run out of cards in their hand compared to the others; i.e. the first player to run out of cards is first place for that game, the second player to do so is second, the third is third, and the player with cards remaining at the end of the game is fourth.

### Instant Wins
There are some hands containing that are instant wins:
  * __four 2's__ - all four 2's and nine other cards
  * __6 pairs__ - six pairs and one other card
  * __4 triples__ - four triples and one other card
  * __dragon__ - one card of every single rank

Players declare instant wins before the game starts, displaying their hand for inspection by the other players. A player with an instant win then do not play in the game, but are considered as placing first in that game.

The game proceeds as usual, with the player who won the previous round starting. If the player with an instant win won the previous round, the player after them counter-clockwise starts in their place.

If multiple players have an instant win, ranking is based on the ranking of the previous game.

## House Rule - Go Fish
_(As mentioned at the beginning, rules for tiến lên vary wildly between play groups so all of the rules above may be seen as house rules. However, this rule is specifically one not taught to me when first learning the game and was instead developed by myself and my cousin and is now normal among our family. The rule was inspired by the card game Go Fish, hence the name.)_

When one player chops another during a game, they are entitled to a card from that player for the next game.

After cards have been dealt for the following game, but before the following game begins, the player who chopped gets a card of the rank of their choosing from the player they chopped. If the chopped player has a card of that rank, they must give the card of the highest suit of that rank in their hand to the player who chopped them. If the chopped player does not have a card of the requested rank, the player who chopped them requests a card of another rank until the chopped player has a card of that rank to give them. _(Traditionally, if the chopped player doesn't have a card of the requested rank, they say "Go Fish," contributing to the rule's name.)_ The player who chopped them then gives the chopped player any card in their hand.

While requests and thus the rank of card received by player who chopped are public, the exact cards swapped are hidden from other players.

If multiple chops occur during a game, card swaps happen in the order they happened during the game. For example, if player A chops player B, and then player B chops player C, then first A would get a card from B, then B would get a card from C.

If a player's chop is beaten by another chop, the player with the beating chop can request the amount of cards the original chopper was getting, plus one, from that player. The original chopper still gets to request cards from whoever they chopped. In the case of getting multiple cards, card requests happen one at a time and are handled separately. For example, if player A chops player B, and then player C beats player A's chop, then A would get a card from B, then C would get a card from A, and then C would get another card from A. C would not be able to request two ranks at once and must completely finish the first request by giving a card back to A before requesting the second card.

## Miscellaneous
Typically players do not have to disclose how many cards they have in their hand at any point, but players may agree to be honest beforehand.

Traditionally the fourth-placed player of each game shuffles and deals for the next game.

Some of the terminology in these rules (notably, _combination_, _round_, _center_) are used for clarity in these rules, but are not normally used in describing/playing.

Some traditional terminology used in my family not mentioned in these rules:
* _trash_ - cards in a hand that do not fit into a multi-card combination
* _winner_ - the player who places first in a game, may be said to have _won_
* _loser_ - the player who places fourth in a game, may be said to have _lost_
